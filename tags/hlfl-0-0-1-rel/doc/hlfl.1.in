.SH DESCRIPTION

.B hlfl
is a tool which can produce several types of firewalls from a given
set of rules written in a special language also called hlfl (however
awkward it is).

.B hlfl
attempts to make the best use of the features of the underlying
firewall, so that the conversion of a stateless to a stateful
requires no modification to the original script


.SH HLFL - THE 'LANGUAGE'


A complete description of the hlfl syntax is in @datadir@/hlfl/syntax.txt
Each order must fit on one line. The syntax is :
.LP
.br
protocol (local) operator (remote) [interface] keywords
.br
.LP

Where :
.IP protocol
must be one of
.I tcp
,
.I udp
,
.I icmp
or
.I all

.IP "(local) and (remote)"
contain the IP addresses (and tcp and udp ports) of both side. Multiple IPs may be specified.  For instance :
.LP
.br
		(192.168.1.1 21 | 192.168.2.1 80)
.br

Means 'port 21 of 192.168.1.1 or port 80 of 192.168.2.1'. The port range
syntax is the same as, say, nmap(1). The next statements are valid :
.br
	tcp (192.168.1.1 21,22,1024-3128,4000-) -> (any)
.br
 	tcp ((192.168.1.1|192.168.2.1) 21,22,1024-) -> (any)
.br

.B Note
: it is very important to understand that
.I local
and
.I remote
can
.B not
be exchanged.
.I local
is the thing you want to protect, and
.I remote
is the other party. Be sure to understand that or your rules will not
work and you won't like hlfl.




.IP operator

must be one of the defined operators. The following list of operators has been
defined :
.br
->   : accept outgoing
.br
<-   : accept incoming
.br
<->  : accept outgoing and incoming
.br
<=>>  : accept outgoing and incoming if the communication was established by the local side first
.br
<<=> : same as above except that the communication must be established by the
remote side first
.br
X->  : deny outgoing
.br
X!-> : reject outgoing
.br
<-X  : deny incoming
.br
<-X! : reject incoming
.br
X    : deny outgoing and incoming
.br
X!   : reject outgoing and incoming
.br

Full text operators are allowed. The syntax is :
.br
operator ::= "accept" | "deny" | "reject" [ "from" | "to" | "and" | "established" | "log" ]
.br

It is possible to combine full text operators with symbolic ones. This
can be done for logging support.

.IP [interface]

interface is the name of the interface to apply the rule to

.IP keyword

additional keyword. At this time, only the keyword
.I nomix
has been defined. Imagine you write the rule:
.LP
.br
	tcp (192.168.1.1 | 192.168.2.1) <-> (172.22.0.1 | 172.22.0.2)

.br

If the keyword
.I nomix
is not added at the end of the rule, then this rule means :
.br
- accept tcp traffic between 192.168.1.1 and 172.22.0.1
.br
- accept tcp traffic between 192.168.1.1 and 172.22.0.2
.br
- accept tcp traffic between 192.168.2.1 and 172.22.0.1
.br
- accept tcp traffic between 192.168.2.1 and 172.22.0.2
.br

Now, if
.I nomix
is added at the end of the rule, then it means :
.br
- accept tcp traffic between 192.168.1.1 and 172.22.0.1
.br
- accept tcp traffic between 192.168.2.1 and 172.22.0.2
.br



It is possible to define words using the
.I define
instruction :
.br
	define my_net 192.168.1.0/24
.br
	define ssh 22
.br
	define my_interface ne1
.br
	tcp (my_net 22) <<=> (any 1020-) [my_interface]

.br

The
.I include
keyword allows you to include other files.
.br

	include /path/to/my/file.hlfl
.br
	include file.hlfl
.br

The second
.I include
statement will include the file
.I hflf.fl
which is in the current working directory.

It is also possible to include 'systems' file, using brackets :
.br
	include <services.hlfl>
.br

This statement includes the file @datadir@/hlfl/services.hlfl,
which contains the definition of common tcp and udp services.




Lines starting with '#' or '%' are treated as comments. '#' comments will be
integrated in the final file, whereas '%' comments will be dropped :
.br
% include myfile.hlfl which contains useful defintions
.br
include myfile.hlfl
.br
# deny tcp
.br
tcp (any) X (any)
.br

Will give, in ipfw :
.br
# deny tcp
.br
ipfw -f add deny tcp from any to any
.br


Lines starting with a '!' will be included as commands in the generated
file. This reduces portability, but this allow you to have all your firewall
configuration stored in one .hlfl file. For instance, I use at home :
.br
!ipchains -s 192.168.1.0 -d 0/0 -i eth1 -j MASQ
.br
tcp (any) -> (any) [eth1]
.br

I use ipchains, so I included my ipchains masquerading policy in my
configuration file. If I wanted to change my firewall to something
else (top-notch ipfilter because ipfilter is _the_ way to go),
then I'll have to change (remove actually) the line starting by '!'.

.br

It is possible to define conditional inclusion. For instance,
this rule makes no sense if I am generating an ipf firewall,
so the 'if(
.I type
)' statement exists :

.br
% only include the following in the case we are generating an
.br
% ipchains firewall. Generate a warning if we are not using
.br
% ipchains

.br

!if(ipchains) ipchains -s 192.168.1.0 -d 0/0 -i eth1 -j MASQ
.br
! else echo "Warning - NAT is not handled in this configuration"
.br


.SH EXAMPLE

see @datadir@/hlfl/ for real-life examples.

.SH NOTE

By default, the rules are permissives, everything is allowed to
pass to anywhere. If you want to change that default, add
.LP
.br
all (any) X (any)
.br
.LP
at the
.B end 
of your rules.

.SH AUTHORS

hlfl was written by Renaud Deraison <deraison@hlfl.org> because the day
he had to convert his ipfw firewall to ipfilter, he sweared he'd never do that
again.
.br
Arnaud Launay <launay@hlfl.org> joined later on, and took actively part in
the project.

- hlfl 'as is' should not change much in the future,
  except that it will handle more languages in
  the future. Its name may change though, as it will
  become the low level of our suite

- A new utility will be created (names are welcome). This
  utility will be used for the description of the networks
  and will generate hlfl files for each firewall.

- bklein volunteered to write a GUI on top of that. I want to
  make it optional, but it may be a good thing.

So, our program will run that way :

		GUI
		 |
		nameless high level tool to describe
		networks and intra-network traffic
			/      |             \
		router1.hlfl  router2.hlfl  routeur3.hlfl
		      |        |              |
		    hlfl     hlfl            hlfl
		      |        |              |
		  config    config          config
		  file       file  	    file


The idea is to write small tools that can be used together, rather than
create a single monster.

bklein suggested that we could also configure routing and fancy stuff
such as nat. We could do that with another tool (hlrl - high level
routing language ???), which would operate at the same level as
hlfl :

		GUI
		 |
		 nameless prog
		 /  \
	config.hlfl config.hlrl
   	 	|      |
		hlfl	hlrl
		 \    /
		  config file [there may be more than one file]

	HLFL Coding Style

Indentation is one space long.
Braces shouldn't be culled with else or if.
Procedures should be splitted on lines.

If this hurts you when coding, you could reformat the code you want to send
by using indent with the following options:

indent -nbc -kr -l80 -psl -i1 -lp -ip1 -sc -bl -nce
